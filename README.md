## Objective 🎯

The main goal of this project was to learn how to integrate an API into a Java project. The API used for this purpose was the Standard ExchangeRate-API endpoint.

## Features ✨

- **Real-time Conversion:** Fetches the latest exchange rates using the ExchangeRate API.
- **Currency Validation:** Ensures that the currency codes entered by the user are valid.
- **Multiple Conversions:** Allows the user to perform multiple conversions in one session.
- **Available Currencies:** Displays a list of supported currencies.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Internet connection for fetching real-time exchange rates.

## Error Handling 🛠️

- **Invalid Currency Code:** If you enter an invalid currency code (not exactly three uppercase letters), the application will prompt you to enter a valid code.
- **API Errors:** If there is an issue fetching the exchange rate, the application will display an error message.
